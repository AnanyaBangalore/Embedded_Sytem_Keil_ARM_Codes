# Embedded_Sytem_Keil_ARM_Codes
My Embedded Systems lab files can be found in this repository. The files include of my coursework's original source code, data sheets, and other pertinent materials.

Each lab file offers a brief summary of the project's function and goal and corresponds to a particular Embedded Systems idea or application. The files are arranged according to lab sessions and include information on a variety of subjects, such as real-time operating systems, sensors, and microcontrollers.

Documentation that gives a summary of the Embedded Systems ideas used and the outcomes is also included in the lab files. If you're interested in embedded systems or want to improve your knowledge and skills in this field, you can use this documentation as a reference manual.
